## Create a giphy browser with routing

- Create a route with a parameter paramter
- Create a nav that includes Links to the following paths: "/giphy/cat", "/giphy/dog", "/giphy/fish"
- The route should show your Giphy component and use the route parameter as the kind of giphy to search for
    - Hint: create the giphy URL using a function that takes the search term as an argument
